The solution involves correctly calling the superclass's implementation in your overridden methods. Here's an example of how to fix the problem:

**Incorrect Implementation (bug.m):**
```objectivec
@implementation MyCustomObject
- (id)retain {
    // INCORRECT: Missing [super retain]
    _retainCount++;
    return self;
}
- (oneway void)release {
    // INCORRECT: Missing [super release]
    _retainCount--;
    if (_retainCount == 0) {
        [self dealloc];
    }
}
@end
```

**Correct Implementation (bugSolution.m):**
```objectivec
@implementation MyCustomObject
- (id)retain {
    // CORRECT: Calls super's retain method
    return [super retain];
}
- (oneway void)release {
    // CORRECT: Calls super's release method
    [super release];
}
@end
```
By always calling `[super retain]` and `[super release]`, we guarantee that ARC's built-in mechanisms handle the underlying reference count management, preventing memory management errors.
