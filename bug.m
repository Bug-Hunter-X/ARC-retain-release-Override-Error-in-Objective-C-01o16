In Objective-C, a less common error stems from the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods in classes that inherit from `NSObject`.  If you override `retain`, `release`, or `autorelease` without meticulous care, you might introduce memory management inconsistencies.  Forgetting to call `[super retain]`, `[super release]`, or `[super autorelease]` in your overridden methods, or incorrectly handling reference counts, can lead to unexpected crashes or memory leaks.  This is more likely in legacy code or when interfacing with non-ARC components.
