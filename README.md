# Objective-C ARC retain/release Override Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Objective-C related to overriding the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods within a class inheriting from `NSObject` when using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Incorrectly overriding these methods can lead to memory leaks or unexpected application crashes.

## The Problem

When overriding memory management methods in ARC, it's crucial to ensure correct interaction with the superclass's implementation.  Forgetting to call `[super retain]`, `[super release]`, or `[super autorelease]` (where appropriate) can easily disrupt reference counting and introduce subtle memory issues.

## The Solution

The correct way to override `retain`, `release`, or `autorelease` methods involves explicitly calling the superclass's implementation, ensuring proper reference count maintenance.
